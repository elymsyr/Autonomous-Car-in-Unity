# Autonomous Car in Unity

The project mainly aims to develop an autonomous car using a Unity 3D environment and complete the [NHTSA Levels of Automation](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-05/Level-of-Automation-052522-tag.pdf) one by one. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) and [Technologies](#technologies) for more detail.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Simple Unity 3D Environment
  - The environment should be suitable for object detection tasks.
  - Car controls must be realistic enough to simulate an autonomous vehicle.
  - Integration with stereo camera sensors for realistic input data.

- [ ] 3D Object Detection Model (KITTI Dataset)
  - Train a 3D object detection model using the KITTI dataset.
  - The autonomous car should rely on stereo cameras (no LiDAR).
  - Apply the trained model to detect and localize objects in the Unity environment.

- [ ] Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) Transformer System
  - Implement a BEV Transformer System for 3D space prediction.
  - Utilize stereo vision to predict the 3D structure of the environment.
  - Explore combining the stereo vision system with more advanced models for enhanced accuracy.
